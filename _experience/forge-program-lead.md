Forge (formerly HackCville, which is what it was called when I was a student) is a community of self-motivated, entrepreneurial students looking to take control of their education. The center of HackCville is it's clubhouses located at #9 Elliewood Avenue in Charlottesville, VA - a space for members and students to collaborate, work, and learn.

As a second-year at UVA, I got involved at HackCville in the Hustle Class, which is a semester-long program teaching the basics of entrepreneurship. I learned about startups and how to think like like a founder. I immediately wanted to get more involved, and became an assistant on the Alumni Relations and Operations teams my third-year. On those teams, I helped reach out to alumni and build the HackCville network, and helped with making plans to redesign the website. My fourth-year, I became a staff member; staff members are the student leaders of HackCville that help it run.

In Fall, 2016, I was the Skills Development Manager and my goal was to help students gain the skills they need to succeed in the entrepreneurial world. My team, involving 3 coordinators, hosted 2-3 workshops, talks, and office hours a week, reaching an audience of over 600 students. Talks are short 1 hour seminars by professionals in industries ranging from business to technology and design. Workshops are 2-3 hours long and are much more hands on, like the Introduction to Python workshop I hosted last year where I taught 18 non-CS students how to hit the ground running with Python. Lastly, office hours were a new concept this year that gave students the opportunity to come and sit down in a casual setting with one of the HackCville managers and chat about a topic or get help with their personal projects.

In Spring, 2017, I acted as the program-lead for the new HackCville program Hack Track. Hack Track focuses on getting projects started and helping students learn the skills necessary to make their work come alive. I host open hours each week where myself and my two TAs sit down with groups and help them work through their process. We also help organize workshops where Hack Trackers can go and learn from an expert on various topic, such as web development, app development, and photography.
