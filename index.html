        Hi! I'm Mike Verdicchio, a software engineer in Northern Virginia at
        <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/">Capital One Shopping</a>
        (formerly Paribus & Wikibuy). I grew up in Mechanicsville, VA, just
        north of Richmond. I graduated in 2017 from the University of Virginia,
        with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm definitely a collector of interests. I'm fascinated by electronics
        and low-level firmware/driver development, which led me to studying
        computer engineering instead of computer science. I'm passionate about
        entrepreneurship, empowering aspiring engineers, and a long life of
        education. I'm also a firm believer in the UVA mentality of a
        Jeffersonian Engineer: one that can do great engineering work, but also
        understand the societal impacts of their designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being an engineer, my passion is to design things that excite people in
        this world. I'm interested in being a part of developing the circuitry
        and controls behind cutting-edge electronics that bring new and improved
        ways of living our lives, such as artificially intelligent robots,
        engine controllers, and audio electronics. For this reason, I see a
        graduate degree in my future, either in engineering or business. I'm
        also very interested in intellectual property law and hope to one day
        incorporate that into my career.
